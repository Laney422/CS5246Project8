1. The RedditPostCrawler.ipynb is used to craw data from reddit.
2. The Data_preprocessing&Sampling.ipynb primarily serves for data concatenation, cleaning, and sampling. By running this script, we can obtain our original multi-class Reddit dataset on mental health status as well as a binary classification dataset on suicidal tendencies. Additionally, we examined word frequencies and generate word clouds to gain preliminary insights into the text content.
3. The KeywordExtract&Remove.ipynb This ipynb document mainly implements Textrank to extract keywords and analyzes the negative emotions with the best predicted scores. We also implemented the removal of keywords to compare the importance of keyword removal on classification prediction.
4. The KeywordAugment&LR.ipynb mainly implements the replacement of selected keywords with synonyms and implements a Train-test split. It utilizes TF-IDF features and emotion scores to train a Logistic Regression model as the baseline model.
