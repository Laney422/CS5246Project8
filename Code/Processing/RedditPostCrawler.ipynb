      "\n",
      "In December 2022, I've accepted an offer to do a masters program in Canada 🇨🇦 as I really wanted to live there and move there eventually. At around the same time, I was just settling in to my new role as an engineering manager in a fast growing remote startup after working there for about 2 years. I've had to juggle between those two commitments for a year up to the end of 2023 before adding on yet another commitment, building a startup. We were accepted into a local incubator / accelerator in Canada and that's when I knew things are getting pretty serious as well, we have a pretty solid idea with good potential.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Practice good time-management. Time-management is essential when you're multi-role juggling between a few commitments. Learn to use scheduling tools such as a todo list and calendar. Create a triaging system for requests either from work or school.\n",
      "2. Use tools and software to help you reduce context-switching cost. I've used to use ChatGPT for this sole purpose but found that I've had to look for my notes and copy them over before I can create anything useable for work / school. Now, I'm building my own tool (my startup) to address this specifically by having that integrate directly with multiple note-taking tools + web search.\n",
      "3. Be diplomatic and make really good friends. You'll need really good friends to help cover for you when you can't make it to lectures or wrap up work in time as you're juggling between other commitments. Maintain good relationship and learn to give and take or share your vulnerabilities with others. There might be some who are out there to get you but more often than not, people genuinely want to help.\n",
      "4. Acknowledge that this is not sustainable in the first place and have an end date in mind. Sooner or later, your growth in one or more of those commitments will falter and you'll quickly realize that focusing on one is better than spreading yourself thin.\n",
      "5. Take breaks when you can to recharge even if they're really small breaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope this will help those who feel alone and pressured in tough times like this. Stay strong and know that there is an end for this 💪. Feel free to AMA in this thread and I'll try my best to respond!\n",

If CS is my primary degree, I won’t be able to drop it even if I end up detesting it. I’ll spend the next few months before matriculation trying out some coding, like CS50 maybe, and if I enjoy it enough I’ll try to apply for the restricted 2nd major in CS. If I don’t enjoy it, then I’ll just stick to Life Sciences.

Understandable, heartbreak is not uncommon and people go through it as and when. But maybe the library isn't the best place to be breaking down (at like max volume) since people are trying to fucking study. Anyway, the girl continued crying and ranting, however, it just got louder and louder. Some people in the library were cursing under their breaths 'what the fuck is her problem', I mean same. Like are you fucking 10 and having your first heartbreak?  If not shut the fuck up please. Even on airpods noise cancellation and blasting my study playlist at top volume I can still hear you.

This idea initially began as an intention to establish a classical antiquity interest group in the university I am in (which would partially solve the funding and legitimacy issue), but that would defeat the purpose of reaching out to all youths in Singapore (and perhaps even beyond -- reaching out to the rest of Southeast Asia is not a remote possibility in the medium to long run). For this, we will have to discuss further once the founding team is more or less secured. However, most of the initial events (e.g. sharings, movie screenings, discussions) will require little to no expenses, so the financial barrier to start on a small scale should still be manageable.\n",

In that only 1/3 of your curriculum is your primary major due to common core hogging up space for both your primary and second major.

So while job-hunting, do you have less expertise than them?\n",

The CHS one has lower employability unless I pair it with a second major. I'm more interested in it, but the common core means double major kids ony have 1/3 of curriculum that's their primary major.

Plus, there’s no exams for most HR modules so I feel no drive to care about anything the prof talks about (and once I participate once or twice, I mentally check out for the rest of the lecture). As a result, I go the entire sem never completing a single required reading (and still managing to get a B+ to A grade).

For reference I’m applying for a NUSC Cs degree. And yes I know this question has been asked a million times but the answers are usually the textbook answers of what it’s like, not really many real anecdotes of the experience there.
